The scene shows two armchairs facing a broken tv on a rugged landscape. 

## Shadows

Shadows have been added on most objects. The object that I had trouble 
getting shadows to work properly on was the tesselated ground.

NOTE: Occasionally you will get a spider web looking shadow. This is actually 
caused by the indentations in the chairs.

## Four Effect Choices

1. Procedural Bump Mapping
There is a torus that has been placed on top of the TV. This torus includes 
procedural bump mapping.

2. Tessellation and height mapping.
The ground has been created using tesselation. This utilizes a height map, 
texture, and normal map.

3. Fog
I have added a fog effect on the ground and all objects. However, I did not 
modify the sky to be the same color as the fog.

4. Noise - 3D Clouds
Using noise, I added some "happy clouds"-Bob Ross. These clouds have a rotation 
animation and they change over time.


## Textures Used

- Chairs:
There is a leather texture on the chairs, however, it is barely visible. I 
could crank up the texture visibility, but I didnt want to detract from the lighting effects.

- TV: 
There is a wood texture on the TV. This shows really well. I wished I would have used a separate
texture for the TV glass but I didnt have enough time.

- Tesselation:
The texture of the tesselation is an darkened rock face. 

## Materials

Each object has its own material. I switched between gold and silver materials
